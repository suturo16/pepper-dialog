This software allows the Pepper robot to hold a human-like conversation in the SUTURO16 Project from the Institute of Artificial Intelligence -University of Bremen.

The task of the robot in the project consists in taking care of the clients in a Cafe. The robot welcomes the clients, informs them about the Cafe services, takes their orders, forwards them to the robot baker and informs the clients on the evolution of their requests.
